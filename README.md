Food Order Management is a system that is mainly focused on the concept of ordering food. Account maintenance and billing is made easier. The system mainly has two sections: 
● Customer section 
● Admin section 

Here only the admin has login credentials. A list of items in the restaurant will be displayed by the software. Here, the customer can order food by selecting the food items from the menu and can perform the method of payment either using credit card or cash payment. The admin can view the restaurant activity and manage them. Also, the admin can view the total cash generated in a single day, can view how many people paid their charge either by card or cash, can keep the backup for your menu system and can add and delete the food items.
